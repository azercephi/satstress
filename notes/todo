GridCalc: {{{
=========
Input/output:
  - Output frequency-dependent variables in meta-data
  - Connect python satstress to the web interface
    - Add web-specific fields to the .nc file headers
      - RUN_ID!!!
      - Username/IP address of the person who did the run
    - Convert all old .in files to .ssrun files for gridcalc
    - remove all the old output files

Plotting: {{{
=========
Given a NetCDF file containing variables Ttt_*, Tpt_*, Tpp_* representing the
tensor components of the surface membrane stresses:
  - For a given time/orbital location slice
  - And a given value of NSR_period
  - Display the principal components of the surface stresses
    - tensile stresses as outward arrows, scaled to magnitude
    - compressive stresses as inward arrows, scaled to magnitude
  - Display the magnitude of one of the tensor components
  - Display the magnitude of one of the principal components

Analysis of Geological Superposition Networks: {{{
==============================================
Questions the paper seeks to answer:
  1.) Given a set of geologic features, and their superposition relationships,
  what can be inferred about their relative orders of formation, if:
      A.) reactivation of portions of the features may occur, and
      B.) superposition relationships are somewhat uncertain.
  
  2.) What is the relationship between frequency of re-activation, and the
      fidelity with which the formation history can be recovered?

  3.) What is the relationship between the degree of uncertainty in feature
      superposition relationships, and the fideleity with which their formation
      history can be recovered?
