Python SatStress Tasks:
=======================
  - Write a 'make release x.y.z' function in the Makefile that builds doc,
    removes compiled files and .svn directories, and creates a .tgz archive

  - Write generic release files:
    - README
    - INSTALL
    - LICENSE
    - Put some info on the sample input files (*.grid, *.satellite)

  - Try and do a more standard 'python setup.py install' installation

SatStress:
----------
  - When outputting a Satellite object, also output derived parameters (mass,
    radius, etc) as comments, for reference.

  - Write __str__ methods for NSR and Diurnal that output all of their 
    derived quantities in a human readable way.

GridCalc:
---------
  - Make single slice calculations work sensibly
  - Implement Grid.__str__()
  - Insert all run parameters into netCDF headers
  - Make sure file complies with COARDS convention
  - Implement exception based error-checking
  - Expand Documentation and format for Epydoc output
  - Release on GoogleCode

Love Numbers:
-------------
  - The Love number code should be generalized to
    - allow many layers
    - allow user to specify layer boundaries as radii range
    - use only SI units!

  - Validate John's vs. James' codes (when I get it)

  - For whichever one I decide to release, I should get rid of the front end
    they have and wrap the core subroutine(s) in Python (for input/output),
    unless I end up wanting to actually translate the code into Python.

Better Plotting Tool:
---------------------
  - plot from GridCalc netCDF files using mpl_toolkits.basemap
    - should allow exploration of:
      - NSR (alone)
      - Diurnal (alone)
      - NSR + Diurnal
    - As functions of:
      - time (orbital position) and
      - Delta (as varied through the NSR forcing frequency)
  - either vector (PC) or magnitude (tens, comp) output
  - viewing of the stress tensor components directly
  - plotting of shapefiles (linear features) for visual comparison
  - Europa basemap image in the background (alpha blended)

Migrate web interface:
----------------------
  - Change the PHP script to work with pySatStress
  - Write a script that converts old input files into the new sat/grid format
  - Convert the old preset input files (SaturnEnceladus, etc)
  - Figure out how to serve netCDF data cubes using OpenDAP on Apache
