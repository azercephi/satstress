Python SatStress Tasks:
=======================
Polish the stress library:
--------------------------
  - Format __doc__ strings for use with Epydoc.
  - Generate Epydoc output
  - Sync my SVN repository with GoogleCode
  - Email anyone interested in this stuff
    - Ask for bug reports (including unclear documentation)
    - Ask other people to submit their stress fields!

  - When outputting a Satellite object, also output derived parameters (mass,
    radius, etc) as comments, for reference.
  - Provide some kind of structured input/output for stress field definitions,
    and the frequency dependent parameters... like the Love numbers.

GridCalc:
---------
  - Make single slice calculations work sensibly
  - Implement Grid.__str__()
  - Insert all run parameters into netCDF headers
  - Make sure file complies with COARDS convention
  - Implement exception based error-checking
  - Expand Documentation and format for Epydoc output
  - Release on GoogleCode

Love Numbers:
-------------
  - Wait until I get code from James

  - The Love number code should be generalized to
    - allow many layers
    - allow user to specify layer boundaries as radii range
    - use only SI units!

  - Validate John's vs. James' codes

  - For whichever one I decide to release, I should get rid of the front end
    they have and wrap the core subroutine(s) in Python (for input/output),
    unless I end up wanting to actually translate the code into Python.

Better Plotting Tool:
---------------------
  - plot from GridCalc netCDF files using mpl_toolkits.basemap
    - should allow exploration of:
      - NSR (alone)
      - Diurnal (alone)
      - NSR + Diurnal
    - As functions of:
      - time (orbital position) and
      - Delta (as varied through the NSR forcing frequency)
  - either vector (PC) or magnitude (tens, comp) output
  - viewing of the stress tensor components directly
  - plotting of shapefiles (linear features) for visual comparison
  - Europa basemap image in the background (alpha blended)

Migrate web interface:
----------------------
  - Change the PHP script to work with pySatStress
  - Write a script that converts old input files into the new sat/grid format
  - Convert the old preset input files (SaturnEnceladus, etc)
  - Figure out how to serve netCDF data cubes using OpenDAP on Apache
