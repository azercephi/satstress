Hopefully getting SatStress to work on your system is a relatively painless
process, however, the software does assume you have basic experience with the
Unix shell and programming within a Unix environment (though it should in
theory work on Windows too).  In particular, this installation information
assumes you already have and are able to use:

  - compilers for both C and Fortran.  Development has been done on Mac OS X
    (10.5) using the GNU compilers gcc and g77, so those should definitely
    work.  On other systems, with other compilers, your mileage may vary.

  - the make utility, which manages dependencies between files.

=================================
Required and Recommended Software
=================================

To get the SatStress package working, you'll need to install some other (free)
software first:

  - Python 2.5 or later (http://www.python.org).  If you're running a recent
    install of Linux, or Apple's Leopard operating system (OS X 10.5.x), you
    already have this.  Python is also available for Microsoft Windows, and
    just about any other platform you can think of.

  - SciPy (http://www.scipy.org), a collection of scientific libraries that
    extend the capabilities of the Python language.

In addition, if you want to use the GridCalc module, you'll need:

  - netCDF (http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/), a library of
    routines for storing, retrieving, and annotating regularly gridded
    multi-dimensional datasets.  Developed by Unidata
    (http://www.unidata.ucar.edu)

  - netcdf4-python (http://code.google.com/p/netcdf4-python/), a Python
    interface to the netCDF library.

If you want to actually view GridCalc module output, you'll need a netCDF file
viewing program.  Many commercial software packages can read netCDF files, such
as ESRI ArcGIS and Matlab.  A simple and free reader for OS X is Panoply
(http://www.giss.nasa.gov/tools/panoply/), from NASA.  If you want to really be
able to interact with the outputs from this model, you should install and get
familiar with:

  - Matplotlib/Pylab (http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/), a Matlab-like
    interactive plotting and analysis package, which uses Python as its
    "shell".

=================================
Building and Installing SatStress
=================================

Once you have the required software installed, uncompress and unarchive the
SatStress distribution you downloaded:

    tar -xvzf SatStress-X.Y.Z.tar.gz

then go into the distribution directory that created:

    cd SatStress-X.Y.Z

To build and test the package run:

    make test

If the test cases pass, go ahead and install with:

    make install

If you're not using the GNU Fortran 77 compiler (g77), you'll need to edit the
Makefile for the Love number code, found in:

    SatStress/Love/JohnWahr/Makefile

and tell it what Fortran compiler it ought to be using.
