SatStress is a collection of software that's useful for analyzing the tidal stresses raised on icy satellites by a time varying potential, and for comparing those stresses to tectonic features mapped on the surface of the satellite.  It is based in part on the model described in "[Modeling Stresses on Satellites due to Non-Synchronous Rotation and Orbital Eccentricity Using Gravitational Potential Theory](http://satstress.googlecode.com/files/Wahretal2008.pdf)"; J. Wahr, Z.A. Selvans, M.E. Mullen, A.C. Barr, G.C. Collins, M.M. Selvans, R.T. Pappalardo; _Icarus_ (submitted 2008-03-06).  The repository also contains all of the code that went into the analysis in [Time, Tides and Tectonics on Icy Satellites](http://pqdtopen.proquest.com/#abstract?dispub=3387542), the PhD dissertation of Zane Selvans.

To use this software, you must check the code out of the [SVN repository](https://code.google.com/p/satstress/source/checkout), as directed under the "Source" tab above.
